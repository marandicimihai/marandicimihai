## About Me

I'm a passionate developer with a diverse background in software development. My journey began with **game development** using Unity and C#, where I learned the fundamentals of interactive design and programming. I then ventured into **web development**, exploring web APIs with ASP.NET Core Controllers and later specializing in the FastEndpoints library. On the frontend, I've worked with Blazor and currently focus on Next.js for building modern web applications.

Currently, I'm a programmer at **FTC team RoboRangers 25590**, where I apply my technical skills to competitive robotics. Check out our team at [roborangers.md](https://roborangers.md).
